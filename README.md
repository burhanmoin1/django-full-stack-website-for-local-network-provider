Creating a web application for a local network provider. The web app is based on django as the backend and html, css and JS on the frontend. PostgreSQL is being used as the database. All of the code is written from scratch and made by me Burhan Moin. This is my first full stack web development project.

The web app has multiple different moving parts, like a customer form filler, a customer signup page for internet or tv. And a live chat app to communicate with an agent from the network provider.

The app is still in development and once developed it will be deployed using waitress as the server and nginx as the reverse proxy. Deltacommunication.net is the domain name it shall he hosted on.
